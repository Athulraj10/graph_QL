# GraphQL Repository

This repository serves as a reference for GraphQL implementations and best practices.


## Introduction
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST APIs.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and web development.


### GraphQL Playground
Once the server is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:PORT/` in your browser to access the GraphQL Playground. This interactive tool allows you to explore the GraphQL schema, write and execute queries, and see the results in real-time.
